# a_star

Abstract:
A JavaScript project implementing the A-Star pathfinding algorithm using TheCodingTrain's tutorial video.

Description:
The following project was created using TheCodingTrain's Challenge 51 Video about A\* Pathfinding. This algorithm is a slight alteration on Djikstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path to a destination. This algorithm is traditionally seen on graphs with weighted edges (these weights signifying the cost of reaching from one node to another). This algorithm can be seen in a variety of forms--most obviously in video games (think League of Legends point-and-click pathfinding).

This project was created in JavaScript using the p5 graphics library.
